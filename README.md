# Production Apprentice
The Production Apprentice app is a prototype app intended to be used by a hypothetical Film Production Company that needs to track its data on films in production.

For example, you would need to tack the budget and balance of a film in production, the schedule of when a film production will be shooting, the actors that are cast for this movie, and various other relevant data. This information needs to be stored and accessed in 1 app, as opposed to using various resources.
